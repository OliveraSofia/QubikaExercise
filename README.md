# instructions and strategy

    The data.js file was originally created to store sensitive information and power authentication services. Since the creation API did not work as expected, it was used to feed the tests. Regarding the tests, there are some bugs on the page that did not allow me to do them as I would have liked, so it only validates the creation and not the presence of the categories.
